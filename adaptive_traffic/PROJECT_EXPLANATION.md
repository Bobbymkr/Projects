# Adaptive Traffic Signal Control System
## A Deep Q-Network (DQN) Based Intelligent Traffic Management Solution

---

## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements an **intelligent adaptive traffic signal control system** using **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**. The system automatically optimizes traffic signal timing at intersections by learning from real-time traffic conditions, significantly reducing congestion, wait times, and improving overall traffic flow efficiency.

### Key Innovation
Unlike traditional fixed-time traffic signals, this system uses **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** reinforcement learning to make **real-time, data-driven decisions** about optimal green light duration based on current traffic conditions.

## üß† Technical Implementation

### **1. State Representation**
The system observes the current traffic state as:
- **Queue lengths** for each lane (4-dimensional vector)
- **Wait times** for vehicles in each queue
- **Current phase** (which lanes have green light)

### **2. Action Space**
The agent can choose from discrete green light durations:
- **Range**: 5 to 60 seconds (configurable)
- **Step size**: 5-second increments
- **Total actions**: 12 possible green durations

### **3. Reward Function**
The agent learns to optimize traffic flow through a carefully designed reward function:

```python
Reward = -(Queue Weight √ó Total Queue Length) - (Wait Weight √ó Total Wait Time)
```

**Components**:
- **Queue Penalty**: Discourages long vehicle queues
- **Wait Time Penalty**: Minimizes vehicle waiting time
- **Configurable weights** for fine-tuning behavior

### **4. Learning Process**

#### **Training Phase**:
1. **Environment Reset**: Initialize random traffic conditions
2. **State Observation**: Agent observes current queue lengths
3. **Action Selection**: Agent chooses green light duration
4. **Environment Step**: Simulate traffic flow for chosen duration
5. **Reward Calculation**: Compute reward based on traffic efficiency
6. **Experience Storage**: Store (state, action, reward, next_state) in replay buffer
7. **Network Update**: Train DQN using experience replay

#### **Inference Phase**:
1. **Real-time Observation**: Get current traffic state from video/input
2. **Action Selection**: Use trained network to select optimal green duration
3. **Signal Control**: Apply the recommended timing to traffic signals
