# Project Audit Report

## Repository Status

- **Current Branch**: Created `stabilization` branch from `master`
- **Untracked Files**: `src/utils/` directory (contains the Request Quota Manager implementation)

## System Information

- **OS**: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro (10.0.26100 Build 26100)
- **System Type**: x64-based PC
- **Memory**: 16,163 MB RAM
- **GPU**: Intel(R) UHD Graphics 620 (1GB)
- **Python Version**: 3.13.5
- **Virtual Environment**: `.venv` exists and is activated

## Project Structure

- Well-organized modular structure with separate directories for different components
- Core modules include:
  - `src/env`: Traffic simulation environments
  - `src/rl`: Reinforcement learning implementation
  - `src/vision`: Computer vision for traffic detection
  - `src/forecast`: Traffic forecasting
  - `src/utils`: Utilities including the Request Quota Manager

## Dependencies

- **Core Dependencies**:
  - NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, Pydantic, tqdm
  - Ultralytics (YOLOv8)
  - Gymnasium, Stable-Baselines3
  - TensorFlow
  - PyTorch 2.8.0

- **Missing Dependencies**:
  - SUMO (not found in PATH)
  - GPU acceleration libraries (system has Intel integrated graphics)

## Build and Deployment

- Makefile with comprehensive commands for setup, development, and deployment
- GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- Setup.py with proper package configuration

## Next Steps

1. Set up GPU and system prerequisites
   - Configure GPU acceleration for Intel UHD Graphics or use CPU fallback
   - Install CUDA/cuDNN if compatible with Intel GPU

2. Create isolated Python environment with pinned versions
   - Current environment exists but needs version pinning

3. Install SUMO and set environment variables
   - SUMO not found in PATH
   - Need to install and configure

4. Install GPU-accelerated ML stack
   - Evaluate options for Intel UHD Graphics 620
   - Configure PyTorch and TensorFlow for optimal performance

5. Continue with remaining tasks as per the project plan
